# Mie Theory

Mie theory was proposed by Gustav Mie at 1908 and described the scattering of an electromagnetic plane wave by a homogeneous sphere based on Maxwell Equation [1,2]. Here, we provided the MATLAB code in order to solve Mie Theory on the metallic nanoparticle and also plot the absorption, scattering, and extinction cross section. Beside that, we also wrote the code for coated system based on the equation that was written on Bohren and Huffman book [1]. For the test, we used the dielectric constant for silver from Palik's experimental data.
